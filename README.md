### 'Free' is Libre or Gratis?

. . .

'Free' is as in 'Free Speech', not as in 'Free Beer'.

::: notes
Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price.
We sometimes call it "libre software" to show we don't mean the software is
gratis.

Regardless of how you got your copies of a free software, with charge or
without charge, You always have the freedom to copy and change the software,
even to sell copies.

## Why We Need Free Software?

- Auditablity
- No spying on users
- No imposed upgrades
- Better security
- No monopolies
- ...

::: notes
When closed-source software manufacturers claim that they made improvements in
the program, improved security and restricted backdoors, users are forced to
believe it. Since the source code is not provided, there is no evidence for
such claims.

If users have no control over the software they are using, it can easily spy on
their activity.

If proprietary vendors stop supporting a product, users have two options:
either use an unsupported version of the software, or go for an (unwanted)
upgrade. Imposed upgrading never happens for free software.

Proprietary software doesn't necessarily stop the spreading of viruses and
letting hackers to take over people's computers for sending spam. Because the
software is secret, all users are dependent on the corporation to fix these
kinds of problems.

It is easier and cheaper to switch from one free software to another compared
to switching proprietary software. Free software does not tie you down to any
corporation.
